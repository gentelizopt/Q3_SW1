	<h5>Kimi ni Todoke (From Me to You)</h5>
	<p>The story takes place in Hokkaido. 15-year-old high school freshman Sawako Kuronuma—dubbed Sadako by her classmates for her resemblance to the character from The Ring—has always been feared and misunderstood because of her appearance. Rumors around school report that she can see ghosts and curse people. However, despite her ominous appearance, she is actually a sweet and unassuming girl who only longs to be helpful. She has been shunned for so long that the idea of making friends has become foreign to her. When a popular boy, Kazehaya, begins talking with her, everything changes. She finds herself in a new world, making new friends and talking to different people, and she can't thank Kazehaya enough for giving her these opportunities. Slowly, but surely, a sweet love blossoms between the two as they overcome circumstances and obstacles standing in their way.</p>

	<h3 style="background-color: lightpink;"><font color="#9E0000">Sawako</font></h3>
	<center><img src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/53/07/f0/5307f0612b1342e4f994bce30484ec75.jpg width="200px" height="200px"></center>
	<h5>Kuronuma Sawako</h5>
	<p>Sawako, the main protagonist, is a high school girl in search of friendship, but her resemblance to the horror film character Sadako Yamamura made this difficult. Her unhealthy levels of modesty and ineffective communication skills has prevented her from correcting misconceptions. As a result, she was tragically ostracized by everyone she met, and has forgotten how to understand others and express herself. Despite these obstacles, she remains a pure, positive, and caring person who works hard in everything she does.</p>

<div class="col-sm-4">
	<h3 style="background-color: lightpink;"><font color="#9E0000">Kazehaya Shōta</font></h3>
	<center><img src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/44/f2/0f/44f20f9f65a39236162c6b5540067d9f.jpg width="200px" height="200px"></center>
	<h5>Kazehaya Shōta</h5>
	<p>Shōta is Sawako's friendly classmate, and initially her idol. His popularity is so widespread regardless of gender because of his refreshing exterior. However, Shōta himself does not believe he is refreshing. With a serious, honest personality and his father's inherited stubbornness and temper, Shōta follows his own inflexible ideals and does not mindlessly follow the crowd. Though he treats everyone equally and without any bias, this is because he keeps a certain distance between himself and others, excluding those who he regards as familiar and trustworthy. In Sawako's case, he regarded her existence as special to him from the beginning.</p>

<div class="col-sm-4">
	<h3 style="background-color: lightpink;"><font color="#9E0000">Yano Ayane</font></h3>

	<h5>Yano Ayane</h5>
	<p>Ayane is a close friend of Sawako's and part of Kitahoro's advanced school program. She is fashionable and noted to look mature for her age. An intelligent tactician, Ayane is easily able to decipher people's intentions and use them to her advantage. On the other hand, she gives just enough information to leave enemies and friends alike wondering and thus, force them forward. Generally, Ayane is strong-willed and caring, but also calculating and cold.</p>

<div class="col-sm-4">
	<h3 style="background-color: lightpink;"><font color="#9E0000">Yoshida Chizuru</font></h3>
	<center><img src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/e1/dd/de/e1ddde774fed01ed4ed8a9f67ebfdb50.jpg width="200px" height="200px"></center>
	<h5>Yoshida Chizuru</h5>
	<p>Chizuru is another close friend of Sawako and Ayane and in Kitahoro's basic school program. Her nickname is "Chizu". Her personality is fearless and hot-blooded, with a strong sense of duty and justice. Unlike Sawako and Ayane, Chizuru is extremely loud, brash, and talkative, always ready to speak her mind. She is cheerful with a large amount of fortitude enabling her to show courage in the face of adversity. Despite her intimidating nature, Chizuru has an unexpected sentimental side, often crying out of fear, frustration, anger, humiliation, or even comical effect.</p>

	<h3 style="background-color: lightpink;"><font color="#9E0000">Sanada Ryu</font></h3>

	<h5>Sanada Ryu</h5>
	<p>Ryu is also member of Sawako's group of friends. He is the son of the ramen shop owner of Chizuru Yoshida's favourite ramen shop. He is quiet most of the time and rarely talks, but still can communicate well with Sawako, as they both don't talk much anyway. Ryu and Kazehaya became friends when they were on the baseball team during middle school.</p>

	<h3 style="background-color: lightpink;"><font color="#9E0000">Kurumizawa Ume</font></h3>
	<center><img src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/ca/65/2d/ca652dff9671e142554eca602fd29327.jpg width="200px" height="200px"></center>
	<h5>Kurumizawa Ume</h5>
	<p>A girl who appears friendly and sweet to everyone around her, she has had a huge crush on Kazehaya since their first year of middle school; as a result, she understands his personality well, despite the fact they were never close friends. From when she was first seen, for many chapters she was known only as "Kurumi", which Sawako mistook to be her given name. She dislikes her given name, Ume, because it sounds old-fashioned and prefers to be called her nickname, "Kurumi".</p>
